# Extensions
A few about extension methods benefits.

Each developer can use the extension method to clean and organize their code.
You can see in this project the Program class, is very clean and small because I use the extension method to add services and configurations.
This project is just an example, you imagine in a big project with a lot of services and database configurations, your Program class will be big and dirty.
